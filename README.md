###Description of the Code:

This code demonstrates proficiency in implementing and managing secure network communication, server-client interaction, and WireGuard VPN configuration using Python.

---

#### **1. Secure Server Implementation with Python's Socket Library**
The script starts by implementing a TCP server using Python's `socket` library:
- **Purpose**: The server listens on a specified host and port, accepts client connections, and sends a basic greeting message to connected clients.
- **Skills Demonstrated**:
  - Knowledge of low-level socket programming to establish TCP connections.
  - Network protocols and the ability to handle client-server communication.
  - Effective use of resource management by closing connections properly.

#### **2. API Development with Flask**
A RESTful API endpoint `/api/execute_code` is created using Flask:
- **Purpose**: The API accepts code as JSON, simulating a secure remote code execution mechanism (though requiring added security measures in production).

---

#### **3. Client-Side Connection Handling with Retry Logic**
The client-side logic demonstrates:
- **Purpose**: A resilient mechanism to connect to a server and handle different scenarios like timeouts, connection refusals, and errors.

---

#### **4. Integration of WireGuard VPN Key Generation**
The integration of the `python_wireguard` library is a highlight:
- **Purpose**: Generates WireGuard VPN key pairs (private and public keys) for secure peer-to-peer communication.
